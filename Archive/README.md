# TheCure

## Background
- Aliens control the vast majority of humans. These human puppets are simply known as The Horde.
- Usually, the Horde still retain their intelligence and attack strategically. But every once in a while, the aliens will just send vast swarms of the Horde into a mad attacking frenzy. This is known as a Horde Wave.
- Scientists believe they can find a cure that can be aerosolized and easily spread worldwide. They just need more time and test samples.
- Humanity has dug deep into the underground of a forest. 4 precious tunnels are the only means to go to the surface and collect resources. Do not lose all of them!
